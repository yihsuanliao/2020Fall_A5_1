# IS590PR A6: "High-Tech Sculptures" (Manipulating Numpy 3D arrays)

Complete this solution program so that all Doctests work properly and it solves 
the problems described.  Some empty functions are provided to help guide you. 
You may add or modify their parameters and may create additional functions as 
well.

### The Scenario
Suppose we are trying to carve a lasting sculpture from a "marble" block, and its
intended final 3D shape is given with a 3D array, containing just 1s and 0s to 
indicate where it will be solid vs empty (removed).

We also have a large rectangular prism of floats in a 3D array. These numbers
represent local densities within a block of marble, perhaps having been measured 
externally using some scanning process like sonography, X-ray, or NMR
from 3 axes.

Before we 'carve' or 'sculpt' the shapes from these expensive marble blocks, 
we want to determine which is the best orientation (rotation) to use for each 
one. Best will be determined by calculating mean density and stability of the 
sculptures that would result.

The output should be formatted like this, **but these numbers are made up**. 
Within each block's results, order by stability, then by density (descending):

    Shape File: shape_1.npy
        Block File: marble_block_1.npy   
            Rotation: None                             Mean density: 79.44  Stable
            Rotation: 180 axis 0 to 1                  Mean density: 78.24  Stable
            Rotation: 180 axis 0 to 1, 90 axis 1 to 2  Mean density: 48.24  Stable
            Rotation:  90 axis 1 to 2                  Mean density: 64.11  Unstable
            ...
        
        Block File: marble_block_2.npy
        ...

    Shape File: shape_2.npy
        Block File: marble_block_1.npy   
            Rotation: 180 axis 0 to 1                  Mean density: 82.04  Stable
            Rotation: None                             Mean density: 71.44  Stable
            Rotation:  90 axis 1 to 2                  Mean density: 64.11  Unstable
            Rotation: 180 axis 0 to 1, 90 axis 1 to 2  Mean density: 48.24  Unstable
        ...
        

1.	Which block & orientation results in the highest average density, AFTER 
    being 'carved'. I gave you five block data files, but write your program 
    so that it can read and evaluate MANY such files -- break the habit of 
    copy-and-paste programming!  :-)   Your output should display the 
    answer along with the block's filename and the rotations used. TIPS: You'll 
    need the Numpy nanmean() function to get the correct density. For that, 
    you'll find it overflows with the float16 dtype we have. So convert using 
    astype('float32') before calling nanmean().
2.	For each possible orientation, determine if the sculpture would be 
    stable & balanced without tipping or leaning. So, you need to compute where 
    the center of mass would be and make sure it's within the horizontal 
    boundaries of its base.
    
### Steps to Get Started:

0. It is recommended that you try this assignment individually, but a team of 
    TWO is permitted, in which case YOU MUST BOTH make substantive commits to 
    your shared repository to receive full credit for the work. If you have worked 
    with the same other student all semester, then find a new teammate.
1. Review my earlier video "Collaborating using GitHub & PyCharm" if you need 
to.  Create one and only one fork of this repository PER TEAM.  
2. In the GitHub website, immediately go to your new repository.
3. click "Settings" tab
4. click "Collaborators & teams" or "Manage Access"
5. REMOVE the team from having access to your 
    repository.  **Warning!**  We'll deduct 10% from your score if you don't.
    If you have a team partner, you must add their GitHub ID as a Collaborator 
    with WRITE permission.
6. Return to the \<Code\> tab in YOUR new repository in GitHub.
7. Click "Clone or Download" to get the link you need for PyCharm.
8. As shown in the video and in class session 4, create a new PyCharm project from your repository.
9. Now in PyCharm, write the code needed to make the existing functions and all exiting tests work properly.
10. COMMIT AND PUSH revisions **frequently** as you work on it, until complete.
11. INCLUDE the output text file in your GitHub repository to make checking your calculations easier.

### Helpful References:
Use the SciPy package function to compute the center of mass.
See https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.3.0/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.center_of_mass.html

These Khan Academy pages on Center of Mass are helpful to understand problem 2:

•	https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/linear-momentum/center-of-mass/v/center-of-mass-equation

•	https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/linear-momentum/center-of-mass/a/what-is-center-of-mass
    (the "Topple Limit" section in this page helps explain problem 2 above. 
    But **you are not required to compute tipping angles**, because we want NO tipping.)

Once you calculate the Center of Mass position, you will find this other SciPy 
class very helpful with determining sculpture stability in problem 2. 
ConvexHull should be used to determine if the center of mass is located above 
a spot within the "footprint" of the base.  
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.3.0/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html#scipy.spatial.ConvexHull
See my other example program here that demonstrates how it is helpful in this.
    
### OPTIONAL, try CI: 
Try to experiment with continuous integration. If you do this successfully, 
but have mistakes elsewhere, it can replace up to 10% of the score.

Configure TravisCI to work on your repository and show proof, such as
taking a screenshot of your build history and including that image 
in your GitHub repository where we can see it.  Remember you get TravisCI 
free as part of the GitHub "StudentPack". I have even included a working 
.travis.yml configuration file and requirements.txt to make this much easier.
